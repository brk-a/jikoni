# GitHub Copilot features

* GitHub Copilot offers a range of features to enhance the coding experience some of which may be in public preview
    - The features available to you depend on your plan and whether you are using Copilot as an individual or through an organisation

### 1. Code completion
* Autocomplete-style suggestions from Copilot in supported IDEs (Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, Azure Data Studio, Xcode, Vim/Neovim and Eclipse)
* If you use Visual Studio Code, you can also use next edit suggestions, which will predict the location of the next edit you are likely to make and suggest a completion for it

### 2. Copilot Chat
* A chat interface that lets you ask coding-related questions and update files
* GitHub Copilot Chat is available on the GitHub website, in GitHub Mobile, in supported IDEs (Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, Eclipse IDE and Xcode) and in Windows Terminal
* Users can also use GitHub skills from Copilot Chat (GitHub Skills are not included in the GitHub Copilot Free plan)

### 3. Copilot Edits
* Copilot Edits is available in Visual Studio Code and JetBrains IDEs. Use Copilot Edits to make changes across multiple files directly from a single Copilot Chat prompt
* Copilot Edits has the following modes:
    - Edit mode: Use edit mode when you want more granular control over the edits that Copilot proposes
        - In edit mode, you choose which files Copilot can make changes to, provide context to Copilot with each iteration and decide whether or not to accept the suggested edits after each turn
    - Agent mode: Use agent mode when you have a specific task in mind and want to enable Copilot to autonomously edit your code
        - In agent mode, Copilot determines which files to make changes to, offers code changes and terminal commands to complete the task, and iterates to remediate issues until the original task is complete
        - Agent mode is only available in Visual Studio Code

### 4. GitHub Copilot code review
* AI-generated code review suggestions to help you write better code

### 5. Copilot in the CLI
* A chat-like interface in the terminal, where you can ask questions about the command line
* You can ask Copilot to provide command suggestions or explanations of commands
* Users can also integrate Copilot in Windows Terminal Canary

### 6. Copilot generated pull request summaries
* AI-generated summaries of the changes that were made in a pull request, which files they impact and what a reviewer should focus on when they conduct their review
* This feature is not included in the GitHub Copilot Free plan

### 7. GitHub Copilot Extensions
* GitHub Copilot Extensions are a type of GitHub App that integrates the power of external tools into GitHub Copilot Chat
* Copilot Extensions can be developed by anyone, for private or public use and can be shared with others through the GitHub Marketplace

### 8. Copilot custom instructions
* Enhance Copilot Chat responses by providing contextual details on your preferences, tools and requirements

### 9. Copilot knowledge bases (Copilot Enterprise only)
* Create and manage collections of documentation to use as context for chatting with Copilot
* When you ask a question in Copilot Chat in GitHub or in Visual Studio Code, you can specify a knowledge base as the context for your question

## Summary
* GitHub Copilot provides features to enhance the coding experience, both in your selected IDE and in other interfaces
* The availability of these features depends on your plan and whether you are using Copilot as an individual or through an organisation
